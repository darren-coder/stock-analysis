# stock-analysis

The goal of this assignment was to analyze quarterly stock numbers and retrieve and store data from the excel workbook using VBA.

This was my first time coding so I didn't really have a specific approach. I was able to put together a script that completed all requirements using nested loops and conditionals on the test files. However, I didn't figure out that I needed to declare my variables as Long instead of Integer until today.
